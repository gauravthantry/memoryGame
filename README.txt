The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:
 The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

Timer:
 The Game has a timer which starts elapsing from the first click and ends when the game is completed or refreshed when the game is refreshed.

Rating:
 The star rating depends on the number of moves that the player takes. unflipping two cards is one move in the game. The lesser the moves, the better the ratings will be.
 
 The star ratings are:
   
     3 star   => moves less than 12
     2.5 star => moves grater than 12 and less than 16
     2 star   => moves greater than 16 and less than 20
     1.5 star => moves greater than 20 and less than 24
     1 star   => moves greater than 24 and less than 28
     0.5 star => moves greater than 28
 
 Game completion:
   A player must match all the cards to complete the game. The player can also decide to replay the game by clikcing the refresh button on the overlay screen that appears when a play is over.
